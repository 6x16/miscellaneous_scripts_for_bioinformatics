# miscellaneous_scripts_for_bioinformatics
## Description: A short-script repository for small tasks in handling Bioinformatics data.

This space contains some of my tiny scripts (Python, R, or other programming languages if used) which have helped me in resolving small tasks/steps while conducting my bioinformatic analysis. These scripts are not specified for bioinformatics, instead they are like "text-handlers" or "data-handlers". If you have similar data structure, try to change some lines of the scripts and perhaps it may help you in speeding up the data analysis.
